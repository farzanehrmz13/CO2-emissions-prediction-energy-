# CO2-emissions-prediction-energy-
This is a project for analyzing energy role in causing environmental issues and how different sectors have more impacts on increasing CO2 emissions.
In this project, first, we analyze the total co2 emissions by major regions (USA, European Union, China, India).
Sectoral impact assessment to identify which fuels(coal, oil, natural gas, bioenergy, industrial processes) contributed most to emission changes. 
Data visualization helped us to communicate findings clearly.
Check the findings need to introduce some analytical solutions to make this problem less, or if we don't find one we have to understand what part is becoming problem.
