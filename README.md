# CO2-emissions-prediction-energy-
This is a project for analyzing energy role in causing environmental issues and how different sectors have more impacts on increasing CO2 emissions.

In this project, first, we analyze the total co2 emissions by major regions (USA, European Union, China, India).
Sectoral impact assessment to identify which fuels(coal, oil, natural gas, bioenergy, industrial processes) contributed most to emission changes. 
Data visualization helped us to communicate findings clearly.
Check the findings need to introduce some analytical solutions to make this problem less, or if we don't find one we have to understand what part is becoming problem.

Tools and techs used: Python(libs: Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebook(Kaggle Environment)
Data Source: IEA: Global Energy Review 2025 Dataset
Github for code storage and implementing the website (will be updated regularly)

Research Interests: Climate Change & Energy Policy, Data Science for Sustainability, Sectoral Impact Analysis, Regional Comparisons
